Parse-Cats
==========

Simple Parse Data example with log in/sign up, saving data and queries

To get it working:

1. Make a free Parse account and put your own App Id and Client Key in the App Delegate.
2. Download the Parse Framework and add that in.

Don't forget you need to pull down on the UICollectionView to make it fetch all the cats.
